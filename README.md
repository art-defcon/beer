# 🍺 My Homebrew Recipe Collection 🍻

Welcome to my personal beer recipe vault! This repository contains my homebrew recipes in two popular formats: BeerXML and BrewfatherJson.

## 📋 Format Descriptions

### 🌾 BeerXML
BeerXML is an XML-based standard format for beer recipes that allows for easy sharing between different brewing software. It captures all the essential details of a recipe including:
- Fermentables (grains, extracts, sugars)
- Hops (varieties, amounts, addition times)
- Yeasts
- Mash schedules
- Water profiles
- Fermentation details

### 🧪 BrewfatherJson
BrewfatherJson is the JSON format used by the Brewfather app/software, a popular brewing tool for recipe formulation, brewing session tracking, and inventory management. This format makes it easy to import recipes directly into Brewfather for brewing day calculations and tracking.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The recipes are organized into two main directories:
- `/BeerXML/` - Contains recipes in BeerXML format
- `/BrewfatherJson/` - Contains recipes in Brewfather's JSON format

## 🍻 Current Contents
